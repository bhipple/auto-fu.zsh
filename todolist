spend hours fixing things that I notice are:
    1) broken as hell
    2) inconvenient
    3) possibly license it so that the breakage isn't severe enough to get me sued for someone "rm -rf /"-ing

make man autocompletion suck as much/conflict
make listing not take up the entire screen because it's annoying
maybe get that underline autocompletion going on
mod grml so that the auto completion doesn't always happen because it's inconsistent
make autocompletion stop fucking with people that don't actually want to auto complete
mv file.local file.loc is practically impossible


tab completion on menucompletion
    show the underline prompt on incomplete

using tab to select from the menu with nothing typed for that parameter doesn't allow menu selection
    fix that shit-- I think I fixed it
well I just fixed autocompletion,
    now it just autocompletes everything
        wew
            make it autocomplete on tab menu
                don't make it autocomplete as soon as you start typing tho because you might want to make a new file with a new name that isn't autocompleted and that would be really annoying because that's really shit
fix history completion-- done

on enter don't repeat last command
copy paste seems to be pretty broken
fix the stupid wildcard so it doesn't autocomplete inline
    gotta preserve default/consistent behavior
