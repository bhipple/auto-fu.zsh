spend hours fixing things that I notice are:
    1) broken as hell
    2) inconvenient
    3) possibly license it so that the breakage isn't severe enough to get me sued for someone "rm -rf /"-ing

make man autocompletion suck as much/conflict
make listing not take up the entire screen because it's annoying
maybe get that underline autocompletion going on
mod grml so that the auto completion doesn't always happen because it's inconsistent
make autocompletion stop fucking with people that don't actually want to auto complete
mv file.local file.loc is practically impossible


tab completion on menucompletion
    show the underline prompt on incomplete

using tab to select from the menu with nothing typed for that parameter doesn't allow menu selection
    fix that shit-- I think I fixed it
